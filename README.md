**I'm Stokoe, I'm a professional web developer from the North East of England, UK.**

I've worked on various web applications across a range of sectors, including FinTech, Travel & Tourism, CRMs, ERP Systems and more.

Currently I work full-time for a company based out of _Whitley Bay, Tyne & Wear_ called <a href="https://consil.co.uk/" target="_blank">Consilience</a>.

I also work on several (unreleased) personal projects, including _Developer, Meet Designer_, _Laravel Scaffolder_ and more...
