**I'm Stokoe, I'm a professional web developer from the North East of England, UK.**

Currently I work full-time for a company based out of _Whitley Bay, Tyne & Wear_ called [Consilience](https://consil.co.uk/).

I also work on several (unreleased) personal projects, including _Developer, Meet Designer_, _Laravel Scaffolder_ and more...
